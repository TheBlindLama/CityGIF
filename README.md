# HabboCity Emoji & GIF Extension

Browser extension for HabboCity Nitro chat.

## What it does

- Adds an emoji/GIF picker next to the chat input.
- Converts `:code:` tokens (example: `:dance:`) into custom GIFs in chat.
- Converts supported emoji codes into Twemoji-style images.
- Syncs GIF data from Supabase so updates are shared across users.
- Supports user PIN login for contributor/admin actions.

If someone does not have the extension, they still see readable text codes.
